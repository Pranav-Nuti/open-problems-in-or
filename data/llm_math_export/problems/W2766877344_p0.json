  "latex": "\\begin{problem}[Sequential design for rank aggregation with judge heterogeneity]\nConsider $K\\ge 2$ items with latent utility (score) vector $\\theta=(\\theta_1,\\dots,\\theta_K)\\in\\mathbb{R}^K$ identified up to a location shift (e.g. impose $\\theta_1=0$). Let $\\mathcal{A}=\\{(i,j):1\\le i<j\\le K\\}$ be the set of item pairs.\n\nThere is a (potentially unbounded) population of judges indexed by $u\\in\\mathcal{U}$. Judge $u$ has an unobserved random effect (or parameter) $\\eta_u\\in\\mathbb{R}^d$ capturing heterogeneity, and comparisons made by judge $u$ follow a parametric pairwise-comparison model with probability mass function\n\\[\n\\mathbb{P}(X=1\\mid (i,j),\\theta,\\eta_u)=f^{(u)}_{i,j}(1\\mid \\theta,\\eta_u),\\qquad X\\in\\{0,1\\},\n\\]\nwhere $X=1$ indicates that item $i$ is preferred to item $j$, and $f^{(u)}_{i,j}(\\cdot\\mid\\theta,\\eta_u)$ depends on $(\\theta_i-\\theta_j)$ and on $\\eta_u$ (e.g. a generalized Bradley--Terry--Luce model with judge-specific bias/scale).\n\nAssume a Bayesian model with a prior density $\\rho_\\theta$ on $\\theta$ and a prior (or hierarchical) model for judge effects: for each engaged judge $u$, $\\eta_u\\sim \\rho_\\eta$ i.i.d., independent of $\\theta$. At each time $n=1,2,\\dots$, a decision maker adaptively selects (i) a judge $u_n\\in\\mathcal{U}$ to query and (ii) a pair $a_n=(i_n,j_n)\\in\\mathcal{A}$ to compare, based on the filtration $\\mathcal{F}_n=\\sigma\\big((u_t,a_t,X_t)_{t\\le n-1}\\big)$. Then $X_n$ is observed according to $f^{(u_n)}_{a_n}(\\cdot\\mid\\theta,\\eta_{u_n})$. The decision maker chooses a stopping time $T$ (w.r.t. $\\{\\mathcal{F}_n\\}$) and, upon stopping, outputs a global ranking $R\\in\\mathcal{P}_K$ (the set of permutations of $\\{1,\\dots,K\\}$).\n\nLet $L_K(R,\\theta)$ denote the Kendall's tau distance between the output ranking $R$ and the true ordering induced by $\\theta$ (ties excluded), and let each query incur cost $c>0$, so the total sampling cost is $cT$. The Bayes risk of a sequential policy $\\pi=(\\{(u_n,a_n)\\}_{n\\ge 1},T,R)$ is\n\\[\nV_c(\\pi)=\\mathbb{E}_\\pi\\big[\\,L_K(R,\\theta)+cT\\,\\big],\n\\]\nwhere expectation is over $(\\theta,\\{\\eta_u\\})$ and the adaptive data stream.\n\n\\emph{Open problem:} Design and analyze a sequential policy $\\pi$ for this heterogeneous-judge model that is (i) Bayes-risk optimal or approximately optimal, and in particular (ii) \\emph{asymptotically optimal} as $c\\to 0$ in the sense that\n\\[\n\\lim_{c\\to 0}\\frac{V_c(\\pi)}{\\inf_{\\pi'} V_c(\\pi')}=1,\n\\]\nwhile explicitly accounting for judge heterogeneity via the random effects $\\{\\eta_u\\}$.\n\\end{problem}",
